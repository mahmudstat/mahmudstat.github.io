My current focus is on dveleoping several `R` packages. The most prominent two
are:

a. [`clockplot`](https://www.thinkermahmud.com/clockplot/): plot event times on a
  24-hour clock
b. [`convmoment`](https://www.thinkermahmud.com/convmoment/): converts moments 
  of a distribution to and from central and raw ones
